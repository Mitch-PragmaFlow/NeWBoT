And it takes 1/4 of the time you spend questing for them to come back, so be sure to plan carefully! \nWe've also changed teleportation. You can still teleport home in an emergency, but it's free and you'll lose all your earned resources and experience ðŸ˜±.\nHead over to https://econ.cryptoraiders.xyz/quests to get started! \nclick here for the original announcement: https://discord.com/channels/860057024611876865/860231627514707978/932775466119610408")

And once youâ€™ve equipped a Mount, you can use it for an unlimited number of quests until you unequip the mount. /nJust like questing, while a Mount is equipped it is gone from your wallet so you will not be able to sell it or trade it. Plan accordingly! /nSo saddle up!
