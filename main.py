You can still teleport home in an emergency, but it's free and you'll lose all your earned resources and experience ðŸ˜±.\nHead over to https://econ.cryptoraiders.xyz/quests to get started! \nclick here for the original announcement: https://discord.com/channels/860057024611876865/860231627514707978/932775466119610408"

#Stat's Breakdown graphics

    "Stat calculations now take all 3 Primary Stats (STR/INT/AGI) into account, but with diminishing rates. \n-- You earn a high (regular) multiplier on your highest of the 3, a medium multiplier on your next-highest of the 3, and a low multiplier on your lowest of the 3. \n-- Combat should now loosely follow a RPS (rock-paper-scissors) system. \n-- Primary stats balance each other out (STR > INT > AGI > STR). \n--- Intelligence struggles to deal high damage against Strength without its Crit Damage booster. \n--- Agility struggles to Evade hits from Intelligence builds due to their high Accuracy. \n--- Strength struggles to hit Agility builds due to their high Evasion.\n-- Secondary stats can be used to mitigate this weakness, and are crucial in reducing your susceptibility to your weaknesses. \n\n Additional changes to stat mechanics: \n- Evasion is now subtractive from your opponent's hit chance, whereas previously it was %-based. \n-- This means that, in the past, 100% Evasion meant you would dodge 100% of enemy attacks, regardless of Hit Chance.\n-- Now, it should be more balanced, as Evasion performs well against low-accuracy builds and is countered by high-accuracy builds. \n- Crit Resist has received a significant buff to give it utility for Strength builds.\n- The impact of Runes has been adjusted to reflect these changes as well-- Ice Barrier will no longer offer a significant boost to non-INT builds.\n\n**More in Depth** \n- All 3 ***primary*** stats (STR/INT/AGI) are  used in your HP/Damage/Crit/etc calculations\n - You receive 100% of the impact of your highest primary stat, just as you did before\n- You receive 70% of the impact of your second-highest primary \nstat (in the past it was 0%)\n- You receive 5% of the impact of your lowest primary stat (in the past it was 0%)\nThis allows you to diversify their build a bit, but prevents you from being maxed out in everything \n (The impact of the lowest primary stat might be raised a bit in the future, but we're starting low to avoid OP builds from gear like Krok Jaw, which has good stats on all 3 primaries) \n\nSo AGI should now perform better in PvP, and Secondary Stats (WIS/CHR/LUK) should now result in noticeable changes in their respective areas. If your build seems to have any shortcomings, consider trying an item with the Secondary Stat that best fits your needs ðŸ™‚. \n\nAs always, be sure to check out ðŸ§ theorycrafting for build tips, questions, and discussions. Happy Raiding!"

And once youâ€™ve equipped a Mount, you can use it for an unlimited number of quests until you unequip the mount. /nJust like questing, while a Mount is equipped it is gone from your wallet so you will not be able to sell it or trade it. Plan accordingly! /nSo saddle up!
